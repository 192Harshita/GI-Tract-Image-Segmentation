# GI-Tract-Image-Segmentation
The Gastro-Intestinal (GI) tract is a tunnel of the digestive system that goes right through the body from the mouth to the anus. The nutrients which are present in the food are absorbed by the walls of the GI tract. The GI tract consists of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestine, and anus in the human digestive system. Many people get affected by GI tract cancer leading to the development of tumors in the tract. To treat these tumors, gastroenterologists use X-ray beams to avoid the stomach and intestine. There is a need to segment the stomach and intestine so that gastroenterologists recognize and avoid them while treating tumors using X-rays. In this work, the ResNet34 - U-Net (RU-Net) model is used to segment the stomach, small bowel, and large bowel organs.
